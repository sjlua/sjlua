### About
I'm an IT student who is interested in all sorts of technology, particularly mobile phones. I find mobile phones quite fascinating, as they manage to cram in so much tech in such a small package. My interest began with Android phones, especially GCam mods and custom ROMs, which led to my eventual interest in IT. I enjoy open-source software, with two of my favourites being Bitwarden, the Linux Kernel. 

### Tech stack
Languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Frameworks and libraries: React Native, Expo, Vite, Jetpack Compose
Tools and infrastructure: Git, Ubuntu, Oracle Server, Figma
Spoken languages: English, Filipino (Basic), Korean (Basic)

### Projects
There's a wide variety, from simple web games like *CLOCKWORK*, to multi-platform apps like Dexern the Pokédex. If you're interested, take a look at my [portfolio].(https://sjlua.dev/portfolio).
